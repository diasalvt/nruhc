# nruhc

This package is both an example and a challenge! The main goal is to introduce you to collaborative tools such as GitHub.
To do so, we will use build a fake project about Churn Analysis.

# Overview

We will be investigating churn data from a Telecom company available here:
https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

Today the goal is not to deeply analyze this data but to familiarize ourself with GitHub, Markdown, Python, Jupyter, ... and see how each of us could use these tools.

# Tasks

* Get access to this repository (GitHub Enterprise + demand access to the owner)
* Run the Jupyter notebook
* Create your own folder under '/answer' with your own name and add a file to it
* [Optional] In this file write down as many flags you captured (max 3)
<!-- Here is a flag -->
<!-- M4RD0WN4L1F3 -->

# Structure

At the root you have some Jupyter Notebooks and this very important README.
You can directly run the notebook with the command:
```
jupyter notebook
```

The notebook import all the necessay modules and even load the external data. The user has no complex setup to do and can directly play with it.
